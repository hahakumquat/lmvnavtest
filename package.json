  "description": "Demonstration of how to write a \"Visual Report\" with LMV.  Currently, I just have a simple PieChart and BarChart representing Quantites in the model based on some attribute (e.g., \"Volume\").  If you click on a wedge of the PieChart (or BarChart), it should highlight where those objects are in the model.  You can also select an object in 3D and it will show you where it is on the 2D sheet (assuming it is on the sheet currently loaded into the bottom viewer).  Likewise, you can select an object in 2D and it should Isolate and Fit that object in the 3D view.",
